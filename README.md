# flycheck-sml

A [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) checker for SML based on SML/NJ. Creates a `sml-smlnj` checker that activates automatically in [sml-mode](https://www.smlnj.org/doc/Emacs/sml-mode.html).

## Installation

[SML/NJ](http://www.smlnj.org/) is required for this checker.

Include `flycheck-sml.el` in your `init.el`. flycheck-sml is currently not available through MELPA or the official flycheck repo and must be installed manually.
